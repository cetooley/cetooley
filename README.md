## Who am I?

I am a full stack software developer with 20 years of experience, practically a fossil. Nowadays I write mostly vue.js/python but I also manage servers and build neat hardware. Lately I've been doing iOS development.

## What am I?

I am a meat popsicle.

## Where am I?

I live in virtual and real liminal spaces

## How am I?

Pretty good! Thanks for asking! I could probably do with more sleep, preferably in a nice warm room with some lazy sun shining on me!

If just one of you who reads this knows how awesome you are, then I will be happy. Humanity shines the light of discovery on the dim abyss of unintelligent reality. Hopefully someday I might get to add my light to the glimmering fabric of human achievement.
